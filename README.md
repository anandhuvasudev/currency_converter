## üìÇ Code Overview

The entire application logic is encapsulated within `lib/currency_converter_material.dart`.

-   **`_CurrencyConverterMaterialState`**: The main state class that manages all UI and data logic.
    -   **State Variables**: Holds the current amount, selected currencies (`_fromCurrency`, `_toCurrency`), loading states, and API data.
    -   **`initState()`**: Kicks off the initial data fetch by calling `_fetchCurrencies()`.
-   **Core Functions**:
    -   `_fetchCurrencies()`: Asynchronously fetches and parses the list of available currencies from the API on app startup.
    -   `_convert()`: Takes the user's input amount, constructs the API request, and performs the conversion. Displays the result in a dialog.
    -   `_swapCurrencies()`: A simple but effective function to swap the `_fromCurrency` and `_toCurrency` values and update the UI.
    -   `countryCodeToEmoji()`: A clever helper function that converts a two-letter country code into its corresponding flag emoji.
-   **UI Build Methods**:
    -   `build()`: The main widget build method that structures the screen with an `AppBar` and a `Column` layout.
    -   `_buildAmountField()`: Creates the stylized `TextField` for entering the amount.
    -   `_buildCurrencySwapSection()`: A `Stack` widget that smartly arranges the 'From' and 'To' currency cards with the swap button overlaid in the center.
    -   `_buildCurrencyCard()`: A reusable method to build the information cards for the selected currencies.
    -   `_showCurrencySelection()`: Builds and displays the `ModalBottomSheet` for selecting a new currency.
    -   `_buildConvertButton()`: The primary action button that triggers the `_convert` function.
