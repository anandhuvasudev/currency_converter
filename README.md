## üìÇ Code Structure

The application's logic and UI are self-contained within `lib/currency_converter_material.dart`. The main components are:

-   `_CurrencyConverterMaterialState`: The main stateful widget class.
    -   **State Variables:** Manages the amount, selected currencies, loading states, and error messages.
    -   **API Logic:**
        -   `_fetchCurrencies()`: Fetches the list of all available currencies on app startup.
        -   `_convert()`: Performs the conversion using the amount and selected currencies.
    -   **UI Build Methods:**
        -   `build()`: The main method that constructs the widget tree.
        -   `_buildAmountField()`: Creates the styled text input for the amount.
        -   `_buildCurrencySwapSection()`: Builds the "From" and "To" currency cards with the swap button.
        -   `_buildConvertButton()`: The main call-to-action button.
    -   **Helper Functions:**
        -   `countryCodeToEmoji()`: A clever utility to convert a 2-letter country code into a flag emoji.
        -   `_showResultDialog()` / `_showCurrencySelection()`: Handle dialogs and modal bottom sheets for user interaction.
